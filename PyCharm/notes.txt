Logging Notes:

5 Standard Logging Levels:
 - Debug: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems
 - Info: Conformation that things are working as expected
 - Warning: An indication that something unexpected happened, or indicative of some problem in the near future
 - Error: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform some function
 - Critical: A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running

- Default level of logging is set as Warning and above
