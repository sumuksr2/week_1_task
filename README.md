# Week 1 Task List

## Contents
- PyCharm Directory: Files and notes for the Python Modules
- Splunk Directory: Files and notes for the Splunk content

## Programs Used
The following programs were used to generate the files in this repository:
- PyCharm
- Notepad

## Installation Instructions
All files in this repository are either txt or py files. The txt files can be opened through any text editor but Python is required to open the py files. To be specific, PyCharm was used to work on the py files and they are written using Python 3. No other special instructions are required to run these files.

## Given Instructions
### Splunk
Splunk offers a lot of free tutorial content, which should be a good starting point.  You could also install Splunk on your personal laptop; we will install it on your work laptop when you are on-site.  Familiarize yourself with basic Splunk concepts. 

- Index, source, sourcetypes
- Splunk commands:
   - eval
   - where/search
   - table/fields
   - stats/top/rare
   - timechart/chart
### Python Modules
You should become intimately familiar with the following python modules.  These modules are used extensively in much of the Python automation code currently in use.

- Python Logging library (https://docs.python.org/3.6/howto/logging.html)
   - StreamHandler
   - FileHandler
   - SplunkHecHandler (https://github.com/vavarachen/splunk_hec_handler)
- Requests modules (https://2.python-requests.org/en/master/)
   - GET/POST methods
   - RESTFul API calls
   - Exception handling
### GitHub Monitoring Project
Create a public GitHub account and gain API access using API token.  Try to experiment with Python requests and GitHub API.  You will need to develop the GitHub Monitor tool.  Also, familiarize yourself with basic git commands (pull, clone, status, diff etc).  PyCharm will take care of much of it, but it is still good to know the CLI.
### PyCharm
I heavily favor PyCharm for development.  Take time to install PyCharm community on your personal laptop and play around with it.  I will help you install his on your work laptop and give you a crash course on using it when you are on site.
### Virtual Environment
It is a safe way to develop without polluting the global python environment.
