Splunk Notes:
 
- Splunk: tool to manage logging on numerous systems
 - Horizontal Scalability: Keep providing solutions by increasing systems
 - Problem:
   - Each system writes logs but to access a specific log you must go to that specific system. Not possible to find a specific log in all of the systems. High level analysis is necessary
 - What we need:
   - Analyse the logs generated by systems
   - Get updated information of the logs
   - Never interact with the system directly
 - Splunk Architecture:
   - Components:
      - Universal Forwarder (UF)
         - Collect the data from specific location and forwards the log from the system to the next level Splunk component
         - This is a lightweight component
         - Cannot generate anything else such as reports, dashboards, etc
      - Heavy Forwarder (HF)
         - Place you can go back and write filtering concepts
         - Use regular expression to extract data
      - Indexer
         - Most critical in searching
         - It allows for an arranged list of items
         - Never index everything (as in not all levels of columns)
         - Default is the timestamp of record
      - Search Head
         - Provides nice UI component that helps you to enter some search information to find the specific data
      - License Master
         - Takes care of whats approved for the account
      - Deployment Server
         - Use this to deploy app or problem
 - Commands:
   - Splunk start/stop/status
 - Keywords:
   - Pipeline Set: single instance of this end-to-end data pipeline
   - Index: consists of a collection of subdirectories called buckets
   - Host: device where event originates
   - Source: name of the file, directory, or other input involved in an event
   - Source Types: formats defined by the users (common: HTTP web server logs and Windows event logs)
   - Eval: calculates an expression and puts the value into a field
   - Where: performs arbitrary filtering on the data
   - Search: searches indexes for matching events
   - Table: creates a table using the specified fields
   - Fields: removes fields from search results
   - Stats: provides statistics with an option to group by fields
   - Top: displays the common values of a field
   - Rare: displays the least common values of a field
   - Timechart: create a time series chart and corresponding tale of statistics
   - Chart: returns results in a tabular output for charting
